# Get started

> **Important**: Before you get started with the package, make sure you meet the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

With the package installed you can [place a Draco file into your Assets folder](use-case-editor-import.md) to inspect it.

Beyond that, APIs to [encode](use-case-encoding.md) and [decode](use-case-decoding.md) Draco are provided.

Ready-made components are not part of the core package, but there are samples that demonstrate how to [encode](sample-encode.md) or [decode](sample-decode.md) Draco files or [entire scenes](sample-scene-encode-decode.md) (including menu entries to perform those actions).
