# Troubleshooting

## Native Library on Windows

If you run into an error message similar to this one:

```log
Failed to load 'draco_unity.dll' because one or more of its dependencies could not be loaded
```

The issue might get resolved by installing [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).
