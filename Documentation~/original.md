# Original Draco 3D Data Compression Unity Package

This package's original identifier was `com.atteneder.draco` and was [forked by Unity][fork]. Here's the instructions to use/install the original.

## Via [OpenUPM][OpenUPM]

The recommended way to install is to download and open the [Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/com.atteneder.draco?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=com.atteneder)

It runs a script that installs *Draco 3D Data Compression* Unity Package via the [OpenUPM][OpenUPM] [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html).

Afterwards optional packages are listed in the *Package Manager* (under *My Registries*) and can be installed and updated from there.
